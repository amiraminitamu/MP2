# MP2 Correlation Energy Calculator

A lightweight Python program for computing MP2 (MÃ¸llerâ€“Plesset perturbation theory) correlation energies and generating potential energy surface (PES) plots for molecular systems. This tool is designed for educational use and prototyping in computational chemistry.

---

## Features

- MP2 energy correlation calculation for single molecules
- PES plotting for bond stretching or other coordinates
- Written in clean, minimal Python for readability
- Easy to modify and extend
- Result comparison to PySCF MP2 energies.


## Usage

Run the main script (`main.py`) with your chosen input settings:

```bash
python main.py
```
You can change the molecule coordinates in `molecule.py`.
Output will be written in `out.txt` which includes computed energies. A PES plot will also be saved as plt.png.
